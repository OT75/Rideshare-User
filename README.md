# Rideshare 
# Files are in the master branch
Simple ride sharing flutter mobile application (1 for drivers and 1 for users) using Firebase authentication and Firebase Fire-store as cloud Realtime database and Sqflite as an offline datastore. 



Carpool is a rideshare application designed to facilitate rideshare service to 
customers. carpool can be used by students to share rides to or from AinShams campus. In this 
version of the application, we’ll create a customized version for Faculty of Engineering Community 
at Ainshams University. We’ll focus on ride to or from Abdu-Basha and Abbaseya square. Users 
must sign in with an active account @eng.asu.edu.eg to build a trusted closed community. Carpool 
has a revolutionary strategy in recruiting drivers and operating the service. Carpool is operated by 
students for students. To regulate the service in this pilot project, there will be only two destination 
points Gate 3 and 4 and one start ride time at 7:30 am from different locations and one return ride 
time at 5:30 pm from faculty of engineering campus. Customers who need a ride at 7:30 must 
reserve their seat before 10:00 pm previous day. Customers who need a ride from campus at 5:30 
pm must reserve their seat before 1:00 pm same day.
